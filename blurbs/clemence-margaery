Clemence becomes the second wife of Louis X, after Marguerite of Burgundy; Margaery replaces Sansa Stark as Joffrey Baratheon's fianc&eacute.  Both husbands are choleric, tyrannical rulers.
Both marriages are arranged for political gain.
Both are apparently virtuous, praying and giving alms to the poor.  Clemence's virtue seems to be more genuine than Margaery's.
