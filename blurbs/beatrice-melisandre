Beatrice uses royal blood from the Aunays' tongues to curse Nogaret and Philip IV; Melisandre uses leeches to extract royal blood from Edric Storm (Robert Baratheon's bastard) in order to curse Balon Greyjoy, Robb Stark, and Joffrey Baratheon.
Beatrice believes she has summoned the Devil into the person of Robert of Artois; Melisandre believes Stannis to be the reincarnation of Azor Ahai.  Robert and Stannis participate, somewhat reluctantly and doubtfully, in the spells of Beatrice and Melisandre.
