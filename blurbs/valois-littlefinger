Valois is one of two advisers to Philip the Fair (the other being Enguerrand de Marigny) who run things from "behind the scenes"; Littlefinger is one of two such courtiers of King Robert (the other being Lord Varys).  They are often at odds with their counterparts, and Valois ultimately orchestrates the execution of Marigny.
