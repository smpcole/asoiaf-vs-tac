Both their reigns are looked back on as times of relative peace and stability.
Philip suffers a mysterious affliction (probably a stroke) while hunting and dies a few weeks later; Robert is mortally wounded by a boar while hunting (possibly because he was given too much wine by his squire, Lancel Lannister).
