Both led rebellions against their respective kings (Robert of Artois in support of Edward III's claim to France).
They share many personal traits: tall, strong, noble, cheerful, hot-tempered, hunters, warriors, boors, love whoring, despise money (but love to squander it), hold personal grudges&emdash;and they're both named Robert!  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gamel35">[gamel35]</a>
