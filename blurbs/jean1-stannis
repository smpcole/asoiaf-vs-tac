Stannis is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne; Jean I is the rightful heir to France.
Neither will ever become king--partly because of well-kept royal secrets (Joffrey's bastard birth/Jean I being swapped at birth with the infant son of Guccio and Marie de Cressay), but mostly because the line of succession doesn't mean much if you have no real power.  Possession is nine-tenths the law!
