Beatrice attempts to use black magic to curse Nogaret, Philip IV, and later Mahaut and  Jeanne of Beaumont; Mirri uses blood magic to reduce Khal Drogo to a vegetative state, killing his and Daenerys's unborn child in the process.
Beatrice is both feared and derided as a practitioner of the Black Mass; Mirri is similarly shunned and feared as a maegi.
