Bands of outlaws with a purpose!
The Allies seek to instate Robert, whom they believe to be the rightful heir to Artois, as Count; the Brotherhood plunders and steals in the name of the late Robert Baratheon, whom they still consider the true King of the Seven Kingdoms.
However, whereas Brotherhood aims to protect the weak, the Allies have no such intent, raping and killing indiscriminately.
