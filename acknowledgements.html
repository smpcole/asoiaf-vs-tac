<p>
  Thanks to everyone who helped me make this site!  I'd like to give a special shout out to the following people:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>My friend <a href="http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~acamer4/">Alex Cameron</a>, for lending me books and always being available to bounce ideas off of.  Couldn't have done it without you, buddy!</li>
  <li>The kind folks at <a href="http://asoiaf.westeros.org">A Forum of Ice and Fire</a>, for making the formatting changes I suggested to their <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a>.</li>
  <li>George R. R. Martin and Maurice Druon, for supplying me with countless hours of entertainment and food for thought.</li>
</ul>
